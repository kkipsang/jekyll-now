 The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.

**Accessing the DevTools**

To access the DevTools, open a web page or web app in Google Chrome. Either:

    Select the Chrome menu Chrome Menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select Tools > Developer Tools.
    Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element.

The DevTools window will open at the bottom of your Chrome browser.

There are several useful shortcuts for opening the DevTools:

    Use Ctrl+Shift+I (or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac) to open the DevTools.
    Use Ctrl+Shift+J (or Cmd+Opt+J on Mac) to open the DevTools and bring focus to the Console.
    Use Ctrl+Shift+C (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac) to open the DevTools in Inspect Element mode, or toggle Inspect Element mode if the DevTools are already open.

For your day-to-day workflow, learning the shortcuts will save you time.

**The DevTools window**

The DevTools are organised into task-oriented groups in the toolbar at the top of the window. Each toolbar item and corresponding panel let you work with a specific type of page or app information, including DOM elements, resources, and sources. 


Overall, there are eight main groups of tools available view Developer Tools:

    *Elements
    *Resources
    *Network
    *Sources
    *Timeline
    *Profiles
    *Audits
    *Console
