title: *HTML Editors as Validators*
---

Browser compatibility databases and HTML validators are beginning to work their
way into HTML authoring tools as well. GoLive Cyberstudio (Mac-only; see http://
www.golive.com/) provides a complete database of all the HTML tags and their
browser-support information.
Even more useful is Macromedia Dreamweaver’s “Check Target Browsers” feature.
Authors specify which browsers they are targeting with their site design (Netscape
2.0, 3.0, and 4.0; and Internet Explorer 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0) and Dreamweaver runs a
check to see if any tags or attributes in the document are not supported by the
target browser(s). For more information on Dreamweaver, see http://www.macromedia.com/.
Knowing Your Audience
As with most design challenges, making appropriate decisions regarding which
browsers to support and which new technologies to adopt largely depends on
knowing your audience. Before designing a new site, be sure to spend plenty of
time up front researching the likely platforms, browsers, technical savvy, and
connection speeds of the users you are targeting. If you are redesigning an
existing site, spend time with the server logs to analyze past site usage.
There are no browser-support guidelines that can anticipate every design situation;
however, the following scenarios should start you thinking:
• If you are designing a scientific or academic site, you should probably pay
extra attention to how your site functions in Lynx (or other graphics-free
browsing environments).
• If your site is aimed at a consumer audience—for instance, a site that sells
educational toys to a primarily “mom”-based audience—don’t ignore your
site’s performance and presentation in the AOL browsers.
• If you are designing for a controlled environment, such as a corporate intranet,
or even better, a web-based kiosk, you’ve got it made! Knowing exactly
what browser and platform your viewers are using means you can take full
advantage of the whistles and bells (and even proprietary features) appropriate
to that browser. If you are designing a standalone kiosk, you may even
have the luxury of loading the fonts you want to use. Just be sure your design
won’t crash the browser since there’s no one there to restart it for you immediately.
In these situations, the “current version design” strategy discussed earlier in
this chapter is entirely appropriate (just don’t get spoiled)!
• If you are designing a computer game site aimed at young gaming geeks, you
can probably assume they will have the latest browsers and plug-ins (or will
get them if you say they need them).
For most multipurpose web sites, stick with the safer “Splitting the Difference”
approach to design, or if you have the resources, create multiple versions and
serve them appropriately.

*Considering Your Site’s Purpose*

Another important factor for making web design decisions is knowing how your
site is going to be used. Site users tend to fall into two broad categories: those
who are on a mission for information, and those who are surfing the Web for
entertainment. In general, sites that serve the latter audience have more opportunity
to try out cutting-edge or plug-in technologies that improve the overall user
experience of the site. For informational sites, you wouldn’t want to base the availability
of the information on a client-side technology.
Of course, there are plenty of exceptions to this overly generalized rule. For
instance, WebMonkey (http://www.webmonkey.com/) is an informational site that
uses a DHTML-based interface, based on the assumption that its developer audience
is using the latest tools. WebMonkey also uses browser detection to serve
alternative versions for those without DHTML capabilities. So just because you
have a “serious” site doesn’t mean you should abandon new technologies entirely.
Another unique case is a site that is about the technology being used, such as a
VRML environment. In this situation, you have every right to expect users to use
the appropriate browser or plug-in to catch up with your content. (Although, it still
might be nice to at least provide some screenshots to show the others what they’re
missing!)

**Test! Test! Test!**
The final word in the dilemma of designing for a variety of browsers is always
TEST! Test your site on as many browsers, browser versions, and platform configurations
as you can get your hands on.
Professional web design firms run their sites through a vigorous quality assurance
phase before going “live.” They generally keep a bank of computers of varying
platforms and processing powers that run as many versions of browsers (including
Lynx) as possible.
If you do not have the resources to keep a similar set-up on your own, make the
site available on a private test site and take a look at it on your friends’ computers.
You might view it under corporate conditions (a Windows machine with a 4.0
browser, and a T1 connection), then visit a friend at home to see the same site on
AOL with a 28.8 modem. (If nothing else, it’s a good excuse to get away from your
computer and visit your friends!)
Although your pages will certainly look different in different environments, the
idea is to make sure that nothing is outright broken and that your content is being
communicated clearly
